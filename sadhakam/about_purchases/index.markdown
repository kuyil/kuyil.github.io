### <a id="troubleshoot_subscription"></a>I subscribed, but suddenly I'm unable to access some features/exercises.

If you are a subscriber and unable to access premium features/exercises, the reason could be:
* Your subscription may have expired, or
* Some other temporary technical issue.

First, follow these steps to ensure that the subcription is still active:
* Open Google Play app
* open its menu -> accounts -> Subscriptions. You should see an active subscription for {{ page.app }}.

If you don't see an active subscription for {{ page.app }}, the reason could be one of these two:
* **Your subscription is expired**: Please renew your subscription or buy the *One-Time* feature to get permanent access to all exercises.

Subscriptions usually renew automatically. If it fails to renew, the reason could be that your payment method is outdated (card expired), or low balance etc.

* **You are using a different Google account**: Sign in to Google Play app using your Google account that is used to purchase {{ page.app }} subscription.

If you see {{ page.app }}'s subscription being active on your account, open {{ page.app }}, preferably with internet ON. Wait for a moment, and launch any exercise. It should work.

Apart from these, cleaner apps and clearning {{page.app}} or Google Play's cache also disables premium features and exercises. For more details on fixing these issues, <a href="#troubleshoot_premium">read this</a>.

### <a id="troubleshoot_premium"></a>I purchased, still some levels/exercises don't open?

If you have purchased but unable to access premium exercises, it is a temporary issue caused by one of the following reasons. Did you do any of these?
* Ran a cleaner to free up space in your device?
* Cleared {{ page.app }} or Play store app's cache/data?
* Added a different google account to your phone, or switched user?
* Did your phone face low memory issue recently?

As you may know, purchases are handled by Google Play. When you open {{ page.app }}, it will ask Google Play whether you have bought or rented the exercises in level. If Google Play says yes, {{ page.app }} will enable them. Google Play usually saves your purchases in your device so that your purchases would work even when you are offline. The purchase info may not be readily available when you switch google accounts or clear Play store's cache/data.

* Make sure you are connected to internet. (You'll need internet this one time to retrieve and verify your purchase. Later, you can continue to use the app do all the exercises without internet connection)
* Swipe apps from recent apps list, especially Google Play and {{ page.app }}.

If you have made the *One Time* purchase:

* Open Google Play, open its menu -> accounts -> Order History. You should see {{ page.app }}'s Onetime purchase in your Google Play's order history. If NOT, go back to Google Play's menu, choose the Google account with which you made the purchase and login.
* open {{ page.app }}, preferably with internet ON. Wait for a moment, and come back to {{page.app}}. It should work.
* If you use cleaner app, please exclude {{ page.app }} and Google Play to prevent this problem happening again.

If you are a subscriber:

* See <a href="#troubleshoot_subscription">this question</a> for steps to solve this problem.
