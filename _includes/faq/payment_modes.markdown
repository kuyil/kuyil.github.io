At the end of the transaction, Google informs the app whether the purchase is successful or not. Based on that, the premium feature is enabled. Google ensures that the process is transparent, safe and fully secure.

### What happens if something goes wrong during the purchase?

Don't worry. Your money is safe. Millions of purchases happen every day. Problems are extremely rare. Worst case scenarios are well thought out by Google. If the issue is specific to our app, you can always contact us at <a href="mailto:{{ page.email }}">{{ page.email }}</a>

### My credit/debit card is not accepted!

Some cards fail security check by Google. We see this sometimes with valid Indian credit/debit cards even when all details entered are correct. We do not know the exact reasons why. We are working with Google to prevent this issue.

Meanwhile, if your card is not accepted, please try <a href='#without_card'>other payment methods</a>.

### <a id='without_card'></a>I don't have credit/debit cards. Can I still buy?

Of course, you can buy. The following methods don't require a credit/debit card. Use one of these methods:

* Use <a href='#recharge'>Paytm</a>, <a href='#phonepe'>PhonePe</a> or <a href='#freecharge'>Freecharge</a> to get a Google Play Recharge Code.
* Use your bank account: Use <a href='#netbanking'>netbanking</a> directly.
* Use your bank account: Get a Google Play Recharge Code using <a href='#phonepe'>PhonePe</a> app, with UPI payment option.
* Get a Google Play <a href='#gift_card'>Gift Card</a> from a local shop or order online using cash.
* Pay through your <a href='#carrier_billing'>mobile bill</a>.

### Help! Purchase failed but my card was charged?
You will NOT loose money. In extremely rare cases, transaction may be incomplete after deducting money. If it ever happens, Google will automatically revert the money to your account in a few days.
