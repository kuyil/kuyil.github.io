### I made the purchase. But the feature isn't what I expected. What do I do now?

Please email us at <a href="mailto:{{ page.email }}">{{ page.email }}</a> with the details. We will work on it as our top priority.

If the purchase was made within 2 hours, refund may happen immediately. If the purchase was made within 48 hours, the refund may take 15 minutes to two business days. Obviously, after the refund the specific premium feature will be disabled. You may make a fresh purchase to enable the feature again.
