      <h3>What do I get when I purchase this feature?<br />
        <small>Ads will be completely removed from the app. The screen space vacated is used to present a convenient volume control when playing reference swarams. Removing ads also helps you to save some battery and data on your device.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>Why are you showing ads in the first place?<br />
        <small>Ads help to keep the basic functionality free and help us pay part of our electricity bills while we make apps for Carnatic music. By paying to remove ads, you directly contribute to our efforts. <em>#SupportCarnatic</em></small>
      </h3>

      <h3>I want to remove ads, but I have questions about in-app purchases?<br />
        <small>Glad you asked. We have put together a whole page of frequently asked questions about in-app purchases. Read <a href="{{% site.url %}}/shruti/about_purchases">here</a>.</small>
