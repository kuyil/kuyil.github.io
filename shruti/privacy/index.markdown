optional_recording_permission_clarification: "
<h2>Why does the App ask for Microphone or Recording Permission?</h2>

The basic functionality of the App is determining the Swaram or Pitch that you sing or play. To do that, the App has to listen to the mic, capture a short duration of audio, typically less than a second to a few seconds and analyze the musical pitch. We do not store or transfer the captured sound, nor use it for any other purpose.
