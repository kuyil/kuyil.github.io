about_app: "The application is a tuner which helps to tune instruments and voice to Carnatic swarams. It detects the swaram by listening to your voice or instrument. It provides visual clues to assist accurate tuning."

in_app_offerings: "The App offers certain features as in-app purchases that enhance or extend the functionality of the App"

optional_recording_permission_clarification: "
<h2>Why does the App ask for Microphone or Recording Permission?</h2>

The basic functionality of the App is determining the Swaram or Pitch that you sing or play. To do that, the App has to listen to the mic, capture a short duration of audio, typically less than a second to a few seconds and analyze the musical pitch. We do not store or transfer the captured sound, nor use it for any other purpose.
"

third_party_services: "Crash Reporting, Analytics, and Advertisement services"
optional_opting_out_of_ads: "
In earlier versions (5.0.6 and before), the App served ads. If you have one of these versions and would not like to be tracked by Advertisement networks, you can buy one of the in-app features that will remove ads, or upgrade to a later version.

Crash Reporting (Firebase) and Analytics modules will still continue to collect anonymous usage information as they are essential for maintaining and improving quality of the App.
