When you buy a premium feature in our app, the purchase is directly handled by Google. Apart from Credit and Debit cards, there are other ways to buy, such as Carrier Billing, Netbanking and Gift cards. This guide will walk you through these payment methods.


When you touch BUY in a premium feature listing, you'll be shown screen similar to the one below.  By touching the title or price in this screen, you can make Google Play show more options:

<div class='row'>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_1.png" alt="purchase dialog"/>
    </div>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_2.png" alt="purchase dialog expanded"/>
    </div>
</div>

Note: These examples are based on Shruti Carnatic Tuner's premium feature Remove Ads, but, the procedure is the same for other premium features. <br />



<h2>Redeem</h2>

Google offers Google Play Gift Cards and Google Play Recharge codes that can be used to buy in-app products. Touch Redeem if you have one of these.

<h3>Paytm</h3>

In India, you can buy <a href='https://paytm.com/google-play-card-recharge'>Google Play Recharge from Paytm</a> for any denomination from ₹100 to ₹1500. These images show how to get your Google Play recharge code. <br />


<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_paytm_1.png" alt="Paytm Google Play Recharge"/>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_paytm_2.png" alt="Paytm Google Play Recharge"/>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_paytm_3.png" alt="Paytm Google Play Recharge"/>
</div>


Alternatively, you can buy physical Google Play Gift Cards from <a href='https://www.snapdeal.com/products/physical-gift-cards?sort=plrty'>snapdeal</a> or <a href='www.amazon.in/Google-Play-Gift-Card-Rs-750/dp/B013P66XVK'>amazon</a>. <br />

<h3>Redeeming</h3>
Once you have a Google Play Recharge code or Gift Card, you can add it as a payment method by touching Redeem in our app. <br />

<div class='row'>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_redeem_1.png" alt="Paytm Google Play Recharge"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_redeem_2.png" alt="Paytm Google Play Recharge"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_redeem_3.png" alt="Paytm Google Play Recharge"/>
    </div>
</div>

<div class='row'>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_redeem_4.png" alt="Paytm Google Play Recharge"/>
    </div>
</div>
<br />

With that, you can proceed to BUY the feature. <br />

Instead of Redeem, if you press <em>Payment methods</em> in the payment screen, you'll be presented all payment options available in your area.


<h2>Use ____ billing</h2>

If you see your mobile operator's name in this option, it means carrier billing is available to you. If you choose this option, you can purchase the in-app feature without a credit/debit card, instead, you'll be charged in your next mobile bill. Currently Idea, Airtel and Vodafone networks support this facility.

    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/purchase_carrier_2.png" alt="Paytm Google Play Recharge"/>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Add Netbanking</h2>

Netbanking is another way to buy in-app features without credit card. Choose your bank from the list and enter credentials to make the purchase.
