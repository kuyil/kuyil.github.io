      <h3>Frequenty Asked Questions</h3>
      <h4>Why do I need this feature?<br />
        <small>
          If any of the following descriptions sound like you, you need this feature:
          <ul>
            <li>You are a carnatic vocal student who wishes to perfect singing of your swara sthanas.
            <li>You are a student learning carnatic instrument (violin, veena, etc.) who wants to improve accuracy of your fingering technique to play all swarams.
            <li>Your instrument requires tuning to swarams other than Sa, Ma<sub>1</sub> and Pa (e.g. tambura with one string tuned to Ni).
            <li>Your veena's melam (frets) needs to be checked and adjusted accordingly.
            <li>You are a professional musician looking for precise reference tones for all swarams.
            <li>You are an experienced musician or advanced student who is trying to fine-tune to authentic carnatic swara sthanas instead of Western Equal Temperament Intervals (typically seen in keyboards and harmoniums).
            <li>Simply you love Shruti Carnatic Tuner and you would like to support the efforts of the developers.
          </ul>

      <h4>What is included in this 12 swarams pack?<br />
        <small>
          This pack extends <em>Shruti Carnatic Tuner</em>'s capability to work for all 12 pure Carnatic swara sthanas.
        </small>
      </h4>

      <h4>Can you be more specific about the swarams supported?<br />
        <small>All 12 carnatic swarams viz., 
          <ol>
            <li><b>Sa</b> <em>Shadjam</em>, 
            <li><b>Ri<sub>1</sub></b> <em>Suddha Rishabam</em>,
            <li><b>Ri<sub>2</sub></b> <em>Chatushruti Rishabam</em> or <b>Ga<sub>1</sub></b> <em>Suddha Gandharam</em>,
            <li><b>Ga<sub>2</sub></b> <em>Sadharana Gandharam</em> or <b>Ri<sub>3</sub></b> <em>Shatshruti Rishabam</em>,
            <li><b>Ga<sub>3</sub></b> <em>Anthara Gandharam</em>,
            <li><b>Ma<sub>1</sub></b> <em>Suddha Madhyamam</em>,
            <li><b>Ma<sub>2</sub></b> <em>Prati Madhyamam</em>,
            <li><b>Pa</b> <em>Panchamam</em>, 
            <li><b>Dha<sub>1</sub></b> <em>Suddha Dhaivatam</em>, 
            <li><b>Dha<sub>2</sub></b> <em>Chatushruti Dhaivatam</em> or <b>Ni<sub>1</sub></b> <em>Suddha Nishadam</em>, 
            <li><b>Ni<sub>2</sub></b> <em>Kaisika Nishadam</em> or <b>Dha<sub>3</sub></b> <em>Shatshruti Dhaivatam</em> and 
            <li><b>Ni<sub>3</sub></b> <em>Kakali Nishadam</em>.
          </ol>
        </small>
      </h4>

      <h4>Does Automatic Swaram Detection work for all these swarams?<br />
        <small>Yes.</small>
      </h4>

      <h4>Are reference tones provided for all these swarams?<br />
        <small>Yes, in 4 Sthayis.</small>
      </h4>

      <h4>Where are Ga<sub>1</sub> and Ni<sub>1</sub>?<br />
        <small>Ri<sub>2</sub> is same as Ga<sub>1</sub>. Dha<sub>2</sub> is same as Ni<sub>1</sub>.</small></h4>

      <h4>There are only two Ga and Ni as far as I know. How come the app shows Ga<sub>3</sub> and Ni<sub>3</sub>?<br />
        <small>Actually there are three Ri-s, Ga-s, Dha-s and Ni-s in Carnatic music. 72 Melakartha scheme is based on all these swarams. See the list above for correct swaram names and corresponding numbering.</small>
      </h4>

     <h4>Aren't there 16 swarams instead of just 12?<br />
       <small>Yes. However, some of the swarams overlap, resulting in only 12 unique swara sthanas. For example, Ri<sub>3</sub> is same as Ga<sub>2</sub>. In other words, this feature pack supports all the swarams.</small> 
     </h4>

     <h4>What do you mean by "pure" Carnatic Swara sthanas?<br />
       <small>The frequency ratios of Carnatic swarams are different from Western Equal temperament (used in Keyboards and Harmoniums). <em>Shruti Carnatic Tuner</em> and this feature pack are implemented based on authentic frequency ratios of Carnatic music. This is what we mean when we say <em>Pure</em> carnatic swara sthanas.</small>
     </h4>

     <h4>Which ratios are used for the swarams?<br />
       <small>These are the ratios used in the feature pack:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Sa</b> <em>1</em>, 
            <li><b>Ri<sub>1</sub></b> <em>16/15</em>,
            <li><b>Ri<sub>2</sub></b> or <b>Ga<sub>1</sub></b> <em>9/8</em>,
            <li><b>Ga<sub>2</sub></b> or <b>Ri<sub>3</sub></b> <em>32/27</em>,
            <li><b>Ga<sub>3</sub></b> <em>5/4</em>,
            <li><b>Ma<sub>1</sub></b> <em>4/3</em>,
            <li><b>Ma<sub>2</sub></b> <em>45/32</em>,
            <li><b>Pa</b> <em>3/2</em>, 
            <li><b>Dha<sub>1</sub></b> <em>128/81</em>, 
            <li><b>Dha<sub>2</sub></b> or <b>Ni<sub>1</sub></b> <em>5/3</em>, 
            <li><b>Ni<sub>2</sub></b> or <b>Dha<sub>3</sub></b> <em>16/9</em> and 
            <li><b>Ni<sub>3</sub></b> <em>15/8</em>.
          </ol>
        </small>
     </h4>

     <h4>Why these specific ratios?<br />
       <small>We are aware there are alternatives to few of the above ratios in the wild. Some of those ratios figure only in gamakams. The ratios presented here are also strongly backed by theory. Concluding on these specific ratios took us months of 
         <ul>
           <li>research on available literature, 
           <li>generation of extensive sound sample library, 
           <li>considerations for the techniques employed by instrumentalists, and 
           <li>listening tests with professional musicians. 
         </ul>In conclusion, the above ratios are authentic and most suitable for contemporary carnatic music practice.
