      <h2>Why do I have to pay?<br />
        <small>Great question! You spent good money in getting this wonderful device. These premium features make your investment worthwhile by enabling your device do really useful things for you, yet cost only a fraction.

      </h2>

      <h2>I never did any online purchase, that too with a mobile phone! Is it safe?<br />
        <small>Absolutely safe and secure. The payment is 100% handled by Google. Any info you provide while making a purchase is directly managed by Google. At the end of the transaction, Google informs the app whether the purchase is successful or not. Based on that, we enable the premium feature. Google makes the process transparent, safe and fully secure.</small>
      </h2>

      <h2>What happens if something goes wrong during the purchase?<br />
        <small>Don't worry. Your money is safe. Millions of purchases happen every day. Worst case scenarios are well thought out by Google. If there is an issue specific to our app, you can always contact us at shruti@kuyil.org. You can get a <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637">refund</a>.</small>
      </h2>

      <h2>What happens when I uninstall and reinstall the app? Should I purchase again?<br />
       <small>Once you make the purchase, the feature is yours "forever". No need to purchase again. You can uninstall and reinstall the app any number of times. No need to purchase the same feature again. Your purchase will be remembered always. This is true for any purchase.</small>
      </h2>

      <h2>What if I lose my phone?<br />
       <small>Your purchases are remembered by Google servers. They are linked to your Google or Gmail account. So, even in the unfortunate event of losing your phone, your purchases are safe.</small>
      </h2>

      <h2>What if I get a new phone? Do I have to buy the feature again?<br />
       <small>No. You don't have to purchase again. The app will retrieve your purchases though internet and enable relevant feature(s). Your purchases are maintained by Google. Google provides information about the purchases to the app, based on your google account. As long as you are using same Google or Gmail account on the device, you will have the feature available on that device. In short, no need make the purchase again.</small>
      </h2>

      <h2>I made the purchase. But the feature isn't what I expected or it simply doesn't work. What do I do now?<br />
        <small>No problem. You can request for a refund from Google using <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/contact/play_request_refund_apps">this form</a>. If the purchase was made within 2 hours, the refund may happen immediately. If the purchase was made within 48 hours, it may take anywhere between 15 minutes to two business days. Please note, after the refund, the purchased premium feature will not work, obviously. You may make a new purchase. Contact us at shruti@kuyil.org if you have any issues. </small>
