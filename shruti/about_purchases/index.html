      <h3>What happens if something goes wrong during the purchase?<br />
        <small>Don't worry. Your money is safe. Millions of purchases happen every day. Problems are extremely rare. Worst case scenarios are well thought out by Google. If the issue is specific to our app, you can always contact us at <a href="mailto:{{ page.email }}">{{ page.email }}</a></small>
      </h3>

      <h3>My credit/debit card is not accepted! <br />
        <small>Some cards fail security check by Google. We see this sometimes with valid Indian credit/debit cards even when all details entered are correct. We do not know the exact reasons why. We are working with Google to prevent this issue. <br />
        Meanwhile, if your card is not accepted, please try <a href='#without_card'>other payment methods</a>.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3 id='without_card'>I don't have credit/debit cards. Can I still buy? <br />
        <small>Of course, you can buy. These methods don't require a credit/debit card:
        <ul>
          <li>Pay through your <a href='#carrier_billing'>mobile bill</a>
          <li>Use Paytm to get a <a href='#recharge'>Google Play recharge</a>
          <li>Get a Google Play <a href='#gift_card'>Gift Card</a>
          <li>Use <a href='#netbanking'>netbanking</a>
        </ul>
        </small>
      </h3>

      <h3>Help! Purchase failed but my card was charged?<br />
        <small>You will NOT loose money. In extremely rare cases, transaction may be incomplete after deducting money. If it ever happens, Google will automatically revert the money to your account in a few days.</small>

      <h3 id="troubleshoot_premium">I purchased 12 Swarams pack. The feature used to work before but it doesn't anymore.<br />
       <small>If you have purchased but unable to use 12 Swarams pack, it is a temporary issue caused by one of the following reasons. Did you do any of these?
	<ul>
	  <li>Ran a cleaner to free up space in your device?
	  <li>Cleared Shruti or Play store app's cache/data?
	  <li>Added a different google account to your phone, or switched user?
	  <li>Did your phone face low memory issue recently?
  	</ul>
	As you may know, purchases are handled by Google Play. When you open Shruti, it will ask Google Play whether you have bought 12 Swarams pack. If Google Play says yes, Shruti will enable the feature. Google Play usually saves your purchases in your device so that your purchases would work even when you are offline. The purchase info may not be readily available when you switch google accounts or clear Play store's cache/data.
	Please try the following:
	<ul>
	  <li>Make sure you are connected to internet. (You'll need internet this one time to retrieve and verify your purchase. Later, you can continue to use the app and 12 Swarams pack without internet)
	  <li>Swipe apps from recent apps list, especially Google Play and Shruti.
	  <li>Open Google Play, open its menu -> accounts -> Order History. You should see 12 Swarams Pack in the list as purchased. If NOT, go back to Google Play's menu, choose the Google account with which you made the purchase and login.
	  <li>If you see 12 Swarams Pack in your Google Play's order history, open Shruti, preferably with internet ON. Wait for a moment, and switch to "All" swarams mode. It should work.
	  <li>If you use cleaner app, please exclude Shruti and Google Play to prevent this problem happening again.
        </ul>
       </small>
      </h3>

      <h3>Do I need internet connection every time to use the premium feature?<br />
       <small>No, after purchase the app and the premium feature can be used without internet connection. But if you clear data/cache of Shruti or Google Play app, or log out from your Google account on Play store, you would need internet connection once to retrieve your purchases and enable premium features. See <a href="#troubleshoot_premium">here.</a></small>
      </h3>

      <h3>Say I bought a premium feature. What happens when I uninstall and reinstall the app? Should I buy again?<br />
       <small>No need to buy again. The feature is yours "forever" once you buy it. You can uninstall and reinstall the app any number of times. Your purchases will be remembered. This is true for all our premium features.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>What if I lose my phone?<br />
       <small>Your purchases are remembered by Google servers. They are linked to your Google or Gmail account. So, even in the unfortunate event of losing your phone, your purchases are safe.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>What if I get a new phone? Do I have to buy the feature again?<br />
       <small>No, you don't have to buy the same feature again. The app will automatically retrieve your purchases and enable relevant feature(s). Google provides info about your purchases based on your google account. You just need to ensure that you use the same Google or Gmail account on the new device.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>I made the purchase. But the feature isn't what I expected. What do I do now?<br />
        <small>Please email us at <a href="mailto:{{ page.email }}">{{ page.email }}</a> with the details. We will work on it as our top priority. Alternatively, you can request for a refund from Google using <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/contact/play_request_refund_apps">this form</a>. If the purchase was made within 2 hours, refund may happen immediately. If the purchase was made within 48 hours, the refund may take 15 minutes to two business days. Obviously, after the refund the specific premium feature will be disabled. You may make a fresh purchase to enable the feature again.</small>
