      <h3>How do I buy these features?<br />
        <small>You can use a credit or debit card, netbanking, or you can simply add the charge to your mobile bill. You can also use Google Play gift cards available on Paytm, amazon, snapdeal and local retailers to pay for in-app features in our app. Continue reading for detailed instructions. </small>
      </h3>

      <h3>I never did any in-app purchase using my phone. Is it safe?<br />
        <small>Absolutely safe and secure. The payment is 100% handled by Google. It is a direct interaction between you and Google. Any info you provide is kept strictly private. At the end of the transaction, Google informs the app whether the purchase is successful or not. Based on that, the premium feature is enabled. Google ensures that the process is transparent, safe and fully secure.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3 id='without_card'>I don't have credit/debit cards. Can I still buy? <br />
        <small>Of course! You can: 
        
        <ul>
          <li>Pay through your mobile bill/balance. See if you have <a href='#carrier_billing'>Carrier Billing</a>, or,
          <li>Use Paytm to get a <a href='#recharge'>Google Play recharge</a>, or,

         <small>Carrier billing is paying for a feature using your mobile bill. If your mobile operator supports it, the charge will be debited from your mobile balance (prepaid) or you'll be charged in your next mobile bill (postpaid). Look for <em>Use Airtel billing</em> or <em>Use Vodafone billing</em> or <em>Use Idea billing</em>, or similar while making the purchase.</small>

      <h3>What happens if something goes wrong during the purchase?<br />
        <small>Don't worry. Your money is safe. Millions of purchases happen every day. Worst case scenarios are well thought out by Google. If the issue is specific to our app, you can always contact us at shruti@kuyil.org.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>Help! Purchase failed but my card was charged?<br />
        <small>You will NOT loose money. Money debited from your account will be automatically reverted by Google in a few days.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>My credit/debit card is not accepted! <br />
        <small>Some cards fail security check by Google. We see this sometimes with valid Indian credit/debit cards even when all details entered are correct. We do not know the exact reasons why. We are working with Google to prevent this issue. Meanwhile, if your card is not accepted, try <a href='#without_card'>other payment modes</a>.</small>
      </h3>


      <h3>Say I made the purchase. What happens when I uninstall and reinstall the app? Should I purchase again?<br />
       <small>No. Once you made the purchase, that feature is yours "forever". No need to purchase again. You can uninstall and reinstall the app any number of times. No need to purchase the same feature again. Your purchase will be remembered always. This is true for any purchase.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>What if I lose my phone?<br />
       <small>Your purchases are remembered by Google servers. They are linked to your Google or Gmail account. So, even in the unfortunate event of losing your phone, your purchases are safe.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>What if I get a new phone? Do I have to buy the feature again?<br />
       <small>No. You don't have to buy the same feature again. The app will automatically retrieve your purchases and enable relevant feature(s). Google provides info about your purchases based on your google account. You just need to ensure that you use the same Google or Gmail account on the new device.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>I made the purchase. But the feature isn't what I expected or it simply doesn't work. What do I do now?<br />
        <small>Please email us at shruti@kuyil.org with the details. We will work on it as our top priority. Alternatively, you can request for a refund from Google using <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/contact/play_request_refund_apps">this form</a>. If the purchase was made within 2 hours, the refund may happen immediately. If the purchase was made within 48 hours, it may take may happen within 15 minutes upto two business days. Obviously, after the refund the specific premium feature will be disabled. You may make a fresh purchase to enable the feature again.</small>
      </h3>

      <h3>Alright, how do I purchase a premium feature?<br />
        <small>Great. First, go back to the premium features screen on the app. Tap on the BUY button of the feature you require. The purchase flow will be initiated. Just follow the on-screen instructions. </small>
